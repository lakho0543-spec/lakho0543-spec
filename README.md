##  About Me

I am a **self-taught Full-Stack Developer** with hands-on experience in building real-world web and app projects. I started my freelancing journey from zero, learning step by step through practice, research, and continuous improvement. I focus on writing clean, organized code and delivering practical solutions.

I believe in **learning by doing**, and most of my skills come from building actual projects, not just tutorials.
